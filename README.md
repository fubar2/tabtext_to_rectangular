# tabtext_to_rectangular

Convert tab delimited rows of varying length by padding all rows shorter than the longest.
Not in the toolshed - this is probably going to break under real testing.
Let me know please.


## Tool made with the Galaxy ToolFactory: https://github.com/fubar2/galaxy_tf_overlay

This tool wraps a [python script](https://github.com/fubar2/tabtext_to_rectangular/blob/main/rectangular_tab_tool.py) to do the work.
It is in the repository and is incorporated into the tool with some small test data.

ToolFactory Galaxy Training Network tutorials [are available here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-generators/tutorial.html)

The ToolFactory history that generated this tool can be imported into any ToolFactory docker or local instance from
[https://github.com/fubar2/tabtext_to_rectangular/raw/main/Galaxy-History-torectangulartabtool.tar.gz](https://github.com/fubar2/tabtext_to_rectangular/raw/main/Galaxy-History-torectangulartabtool.tar.gz)
Using that history, the original generating ToolFactory form can be recreated using the redo button.
Editing the tool id will make a new tool, so all other edits to parameters can be made.
A new tool can be generated without destroying the original sample by altering the tool_id before execution.
